For this part of the task tracking assignment, I had to make a few design choices in how I displayed a User and Tasks. When you open the application, you see the navbar where you can either register or log-in and a list of tasks assigned to users. This gives a preview of what is available in the application. Once you sign in, you're able to create a new task and assign it to another person in the database already. You are able to say whether this assignment is complete, how long it should take for them to complete it and a description/title of the task at hand.
